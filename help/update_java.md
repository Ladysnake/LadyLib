# How to update your Minecraft instance's Java version
Using an outdated Java version can cause numerous issues, most noticeable of which being not being able to use
some mods. Here is how to benefit from latest Java in Minecraft.

## Get the latest Java version
Note: If you already have Java installed and up-to-date on your computer, you may skip this step.

[You can download the Java Runtime Environment here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).
Simply select the version corresponding to your current operating system and execute the downloaded file.

## Configure the Vanilla launcher to use latest Java

2- Click on your profile of choice, check "Java executable" and input the path to your Java binary. 
If you are using Windows, it should be in `C:\Program Files\Java\<installed_version>\bin\javaw.exe`. 
If you are using Linux or Mac, you should be able to use the command `whereis java` to obtain that path.
